# Enhancing Virtual Teleportation: An Evaluation of a Wearable Olfactory Device with Ventilation for Immersive VR Experiences



Abstract—Humans interact with the world using various sensory organs. Vision and hearing are the primary senses that enable us to
perceive the environment and interact with it. Virtual Reality (VR) technology allows users to explore virtual worlds by providing visual
and auditory stimuli. However, current VR experiences are limited in terms of sensory stimulation and immersion, which can hinder
user experience and task performance. Teleporting is a commonly used locomotion method in VR, allowing users to instantly move to
different locations. However, this method can make it difficult to accurately perceive and interact with objects, especially those outside
the user’s field of view. This can lead to unnecessary exploration and frustration, especially in large virtual environments. To address
these limitations, this study investigates the use of a multi-scent device with ventilation to enhance object recognition and immersion
during teleportation in VR. We developed two scent devices: a wearable device and a stationary device. We conducted a user study
with 20 participants to compare the two devices and investigate the effects of scent and ventilation on object recognition, usability, and
user experience. The results showed that the multi-scent device significantly improved object recognition accuracy in situations without
visual information. Ventilation also improved accuracy and user experience. Additionally, the scent device enhanced user satisfaction
and task performance without increasing workload or discomfort. Our findings suggest that multi-scent devices with ventilation can be
a valuable tool for improving object recognition and immersion in VR environments, especially during teleportation. This technology
has the potential to enhance user experience and task performance in various VR applications.
