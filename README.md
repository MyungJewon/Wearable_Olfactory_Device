# Enhancing Virtual Teleportation: An Evaluation of a Wearable Olfactory Device with Ventilation for Immersive VR Experiences



Abstractâ€”Humans interact with the world using various sensory cues such as vision enable us to perceive the environment and interact with it Similarly, Virtual Reality (VR) technology has advanced to offer users enhanced visual and auditory experiences.
However, despite these advancements, VR experiences are limited in terms of having to experience multiple different senses. Another important sense, smell, has been proposed to overcome these limitations. The initial research focus was on introducing various types of olfactory devices. Nevertheless, the structural complexity of these devices makes them difficult to reproduce. In this work, we propose reproducible olfactory device prototypes for VR that emit scents and provide ventilation when interacting with VR environments.
These prototypes include wearable and stationary devices. We conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of the wearable device by applying it to navigation techniques, including Teleportation and Dash. The results suggest that providing olfactory cues via ventilation during exploration improves object ecognition even when the objects are not visually visible. We conclude this work by discussing their limitations and suggesting directions for future research
